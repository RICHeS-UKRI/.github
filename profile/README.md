# Welcome to the RICHeS GitHub Organisation

This GitHub organisation hosts code, documentation, and other digital outputs associated with the **RICHeS â€“ Research Infrastructure for Conservation and Heritage Science** programme.

[RICHeS](https://www.riches.ukri.org/) is a national initiative funded by [UKRI](https://www.ukri.org/) through the [Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/). It aims to strengthen the UKâ€™s capability in conservation and heritage science by creating a sustainable, coordinated research infrastructure that supports interdisciplinary collaboration, access to specialist facilities and expertise, and the development of best practices across the heritage sector.

## About this Organisation

This GitHub space supports the technical and collaborative activities of the RICHeS programme. It is used to:

- Share and maintain code and scripts from RICHeS-funded projects
- Host documentation, metadata schemas, and data models
- Coordinate collaborative development across work packages and partner institutions
- Support community engagement through transparent development and access to research tools

This environment promotes the principles of [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [open research](https://www.ukri.org/manage-your-award/publishing-your-research/open-research/), encouraging accessible, interoperable, and reusable outputs.
