    <td rowspan="2" width="50%"><strong>The RICHeS programme</strong> will unlock access to heritage science facilities by creating a distributed infrastructure of heritage science collections and equipment.

We will fund the development of a heritage science data service to enable researchers and other users to find and access facilities, reference collections and research data relating to heritage science research.

We will also create a dedicated RICHeS headquarters to encourage cooperation, networking and skills sharing.</td>
